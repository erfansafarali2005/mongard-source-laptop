 in every rabbitmq instance we have at leat a vhost . with vhost we set few clusters in a rabbitmq instance , one for django one for celery etc.
 the default rabbitmqs cluster's name is / .

 guest is only avaible in development server

 how to manage rabbitmq nodes : rabbitmqctl (((((((((((((:.

 >> rabbitmqctl add_user 'username' : this can be done with admin UI in management plugin

 >> rabbitmqctl list_users : for getting the list of the users

 >> now we set tags : >> rabbitmqctl set_user_tags amir administrator | !!!!! this tags are only for admin panel not inside code , for code :

 >> now we should set permissions : >> rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p '/' 'amir' ".*" ".*" ".*" : first for configes , second for write and third for read :.* means True
                                                                       ^-> name of the vhost : so thats why we have different vhosts which are different from each other

 >> rabbitmqctl delete -user 'username'
